                    Remeeting is a tool to help you record, transcribe and search important conversations.

                    <h6> 
                            When we took on this project, Remeeting did not have a built-out interface. 
                            While they did have a minimum viable product, there was room for improvement 
                            for the overall user experience. We hoped to improve existing screens as well 
                            as add new interactions/features that would help users easily navigate and use 
                            the product. Our team decided that an entire redesign of the existing platform 
                            would allow Remeeting to address the usability issues with the MVP, create a more 
                            concrete product vision, and more clearly define their target market.

                <h6> 
                    Each member of the team conducted individual user interviews in order to better 
                    understand the needs and frustrations involved with a tool like Remeeting. A few 
                    of the objectives our interviews tried to achieve were the following: <br />

                    • How do users comprehend the product? <br />
                    • How do people visualize conversations? <br />
                    • To what degree do/will people use transcripts? <br />
                    • How would a user interact with the product? How involved are they? <br />

                    In addition to user interviews, each member conducted a usability test with the current MVP. 
                    We also conducted personal walkthroughts of similar, competing products in order to better 
                    understand existing patterns and interactions associated with speech/transcription interfaces.

                <h6> 
                        From the user interviews and usability testing, we saw there were two main use cases for 
                        the product: users looking for verbatim transcriptions and those looking for summaries, 
                        both of which were in professional settings. Using these insights, we developed these 
                        personas to help guide the rest of our design decisions:

                    and better understand how we could simplify the user flow for the redesign.

                        After creating some initial screens, the team began to refine the product
                            vision and decided to simplify the overall product. Rather than create an 
                            entire scheduling feature within the product and complicate the problem we 
                            were trying to solve, we decided to focus solely on the features currently 
                            built in the MVP.
                        We used the analogy of a file cabinet for the platform. After significant
                            discussion, the team decided that Remeeting would serve as a place to save, view, 
                            and edit transcripts for important conversations, meetings, interviews, etc.  With this 
                            refined product vision, we took our lo-fi wireframes and translated them to mid-fidelity.
