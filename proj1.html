                            When we took on this project our client gave us a variety of jobs to choose from, 
                            which we narrowed down to a website redesign and creation of a budeting portal.
                            <br> <br>
    
                            We decided on a budgeting portal because many of Rye Financial’s clients operate on 
                            a budget based system and lack a way to manage their expenses and revenue in relation to 
                            their budget.
                            <br>  <br>
    
                            Through this portal, we hope that businesses will be able to better visualize their budgeting 
                            problems and understand their financial status with more ease.

                <h6> 
                        Our client, Rye Financial, is founded by Stephen Rye Switzer, an independent accountant. 
                        He provides accounting and bookkeeping services for small business, non-profit organizations,
                        and B-corps in the Bay Area. 
                        <br>  <br>
                        Our goal for this project is to design a user portal that improves Stephen’s service and
                        report delievery while allowing his users to more efficiently monitor their budgeting and 
                        finances through a personalized system.

                    <h6> 
                        To better understand the current bookkeeping experiences for accountants and financial advisors 
                        working at our target organizations, we created an interview guide that includes nine questions 
                        as shown below. The questions specifically address: <br>
                        — what type of critical statistics they expect to see from financial reports <br>
                        — how they interact with the bookkeeping tools <br>
                        — how they categorize their transactions <br>
                        — how they maintain and oversee their budgets. <br>

                         insights into different categories and find patterns.  <br>

                        Based on the affinity map, we were able to draw the following insights: <br>
                        — The main tools that users are using are spreadsheet and Quickbooks <br>
                        — Most users are happy with their current bookkeeping system,  so there is no need for 
                        new bookkeeping portal that repeat the same functions <br>
                        — But many users are interested in having a tool that can help them keep track of budget <br>

                    In our redesign, we added more visuals and illustrations that would help reduce the 
                    denseness from having too much text and redesigned the “Service Plan”, “About”, and 
                    “Content” page. We also added a custom service plans page that allows users that do 
                    not necessarily belong to the preset business types written on the “Service Plan” 
                    page to fill out a survey form.
